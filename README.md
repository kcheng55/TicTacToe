# TicTacToe
Simple TicTacToe game
The game is for two players. One player places the X pieces and the other player places the O pieces. The basic game board is a grid of 9 spaces, in a 3 x 3 arrangement (to handle a 5 x 5, 7 x 7 or any other size in the future). When one player covers an entire row, column or diagonal, that player wins the game.
